## What is AI Search for Historical Messages

MemFree now supports AI semantic search for the titles, questions, and answers of your searches.

> This is a paid feature, but all users can experience it for free temporarily.

### What is AI Semantic Search

Compared to traditional full-text search and keyword search, AI semantic search has the following advantages:

1. **Cross-language Understanding Capability**

    - You can find relevant content regardless of the language you use for your search.
    - For example: Entering "AI Semantic Search" will also yield relevant results for "AI 智能搜索".

2. **Intelligent Error Correction**

    - Even if your input contains errors, you can still find the correct results.
    - For example: You can search for "MemFrre" and find results related to "MemFree".

3. **Semantic Understanding Capability**

    - Understands the relationships between words, not limited to exact matches.
    - For example: Searching for "Search Engines" can also find content related to "Query Tool".

4. **Context Awareness**

    - Understands the meaning of search terms in different contexts, providing more accurate search results based on context.
    - For example, "Apple" can intelligently distinguish whether the discussion is about the fruit or the tech company.
