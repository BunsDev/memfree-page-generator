## Background

Recently, when I was generating ultra-long code using MemFree, I noticed that Chrome consumed a large amount of memory, eventually causing the page to crash.

## Problem Analysis

### Search

At first, I suspected the issue was caused by code highlighting. After some research, I indeed found a suspicious point, [rehype-highlight v7.0.0 memory leak](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown/issues/791), but updating the rehype-highlight version did not resolve the problem.

### Analyzing with React Developer Tools

Upon analyzing with React Developer Tools, I found that when the message search was returned in a streaming fashion, the Sidebar component on the left side of the page was being updated frequently, which piqued my curiosity.

To confirm whether it was related to the Sidebar component, I tested it in the Edge browser and discovered that the ultra-long code was generated normally. The data for the Sidebar component mainly consists of search history; in Chrome, my local store had hundreds of messages, while in Edge, there were only a few messages.

At this point, I checked the local store code and identified the problem:

```ts
            updateActiveSearch: (updatedSearch) => {
                set((state) => {
                    if (!state.activeSearch) return state;
                    const newSearch = {
                        ...state.activeSearch,
                        ...updatedSearch,
                    };
                    return {
                        activeSearch: newSearch,
                        searches: state.searches.map((s) => (s.id === newSearch.id ? newSearch : s)),
                    };
                });
            },
```

When the answer text from the search is returned in a streaming manner, I call `updateActiveSearch` to update the current search record. The issue here is that I update the entire `searches` array every time. When there are many historical search messages and the current answer text is long, it results in frequent updates to a long array, leading to a massive allocation and release of memory, ultimately causing the Chrome page to crash.

### Solution

During `updateActiveSearch`, only update `activeSearch` and avoid updating the entire `searches` array. It is sufficient to update the `searches` array once after the search has concluded.

### SidebarList still constantly updates when the search answer returns

After implementing the above optimization, I expected that the SidebarList would no longer update when the search answers were returned; however, I found that SidebarList continued to update.

```ts
export function SidebarList({ user }: SidebarListProps) {
    const { searches, addSearches } = useSearchStore();

interface SearchStore {
    searches: Search[];
    activeId: string | undefined;
    activeSearch: Search | undefined;
    addSearch: (search: Search) => void;
    addSearches: (searches: Search[]) => void;
    setSearches: (searches: Search[]) => void;
    removeSearch: (id: string) => void;
    clearSearches: () => void;
    setActiveSearch: (id: string) => void;
    updateActiveSearch: (updatedSearch: Partial<Search>) => void;
    deleteMessage: (messageId: string) => void;
    syncActiveSearchToSearches: () => void;
}
```

I asked MemFree, and MemFree quickly provided an answer:

It was caused by the subscription mechanism of the Zustand store. When you use `useSearchStore` in a component to obtain multiple states, as long as any one of the states changes, the component will re-render.

```ts
// 1. First, separate the store selectors
const useSearchesSelector = () => useSearchStore((state) => state.searches);
const useAddSearchesSelector = () => useSearchStore((state) => state.addSearches);

// 2. Optimized SidebarList component
export function SidebarList({ user }: SidebarListProps) {
    // Subscribe to different states separately
    const searches = useSearchesSelector();
    const addSearches = useAddSearchesSelector();
}
```

With this alteration, the problem was finally resolved: the SidebarList component would no longer update when the search answers were returned in streaming fashion.

## Why does Zustand cause unrelated components to re-render when one state changes?

This is because Zustand uses strict equality comparison (`===`) by default to determine if the state has changed. When using `useSearchStore()` to get the entire store state, if any part of the state in the store changes, it triggers a re-render of the component.

### Example of Zustand's Default Behavior:

```typescript
// Every time updateActiveSearch is called, even if searches haven't changed, the component will re-render
const { searches, activeSearch } = useSearchStore();
```

### Solutions:

1. **Use shallow comparison**

```typescript
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow';

// Only re-render when the selected state actually changes
const { searches, activeSearch } = useSearchStore(
    (state) => ({
        searches: state.searches,
        activeSearch: state.activeSearch,
    }),
    shallow,
);
```

2. **Manual selectors**

```typescript
// Subscribe to specific states
const searches = useSearchStore((state) => state.searches);
const activeSearch = useSearchStore((state) => state.activeSearch);
```

### In-depth Explanation of Zustand's Principles:

Zustand's state update mechanism:

```typescript
// Simplified Zustand state update logic
function createStore() {
    let state = initialState;
    const listeners = new Set();

    return {
        getState: () => state,
        setState: (newState) => {
            // Even if only one property changes, all listeners will be triggered
            state = { ...state, ...newState };

            // Notify all subscribers
            listeners.forEach((listener) => listener(state));
        },
        subscribe: (listener) => {
            listeners.add(listener);
            return () => listeners.delete(listener);
        },
    };
}
```

### Complete Zustand Optimization Example:

```typescript
import { create } from 'zustand';
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow';

interface SearchStore {
    searches: Search[];
    activeSearch?: Search;
    updateActiveSearch: (update: Partial<Search>) => void;
}

export const useSearchStore = create<SearchStore>()((set) => ({
    searches: [],
    activeSearch: undefined,
    updateActiveSearch: (update) => {
        set((state) => ({
            activeSearch: state.activeSearch ? { ...state.activeSearch, ...update } : undefined,
        }));
    },
}));

// Usage in a component
function SearchComponent() {
    // Method 1: Use shallow comparison
    const { searches, activeSearch } = useSearchStore(
        (state) => ({
            searches: state.searches,
            activeSearch: state.activeSearch,
        }),
        shallow,
    );

    // Method 2: Individual selectors
    const searches = useSearchStore((state) => state.searches);
    const activeSearch = useSearchStore((state) => state.activeSearch);

    // Method 3: Using useMemo and useCallback
    const memoizedSearches = useMemo(() => searches, [searches]);
    const handleUpdateSearch = useCallback((update) => {
        useSearchStore.getState().updateActiveSearch(update);
    }, []);
}
```

### Zustand Performance Optimization Suggestions:

1. **Use selectors**

```typescript
// Precisely control subscribed states
const searches = useSearchStore((state) => state.searches);
const activeSearchId = useSearchStore((state) => state.activeSearch?.id);
```

2. **Avoid unnecessary states**

```typescript
// Do not store derived state in the store
const useSearchStore = create((set) => ({
    // ❌ Not recommended
    searchCount: state.searches.length,

    // ✅ Recommended
    // Calculate when needed
    getSearchCount: () => useSearchStore.getState().searches.length,
}));
```

3. **Split Store**

```typescript
// Separate states with different responsibilities into different stores
const useSearchStore = create((set) => ({
    searches: [],
    // Related to search state
}));

const useUIStore = create((set) => ({
    isLoading: false,
    // Related to UI state
}));
```

## Summary:

Zustand's default behavior leads to full updates when state changes. You can optimize using:

-   Use `shallow` comparison
-   Use precise selectors
-   Update only strongly related, minimally granular states each time
-   Reasonably design store structure
-   Use `useMemo` and `useCallback`

I hope this article helps friends using Zustand.
